\section{Action spectroscopy}
\label{sec:action-spectroscopy}

As discussed in Section \ref{sec:spectroscopy}, in contrast to absorption
spectroscopy, which detects the effect molecules have on light, action
spectroscopy measures effect of light on molecules. Ions are the optimum choice
for action spectroscopy methods because of their charge, which makes it easy to
guide, mass select and trap them efficiently. This section will focus only on
vibrational and rotational \qt{gas-phase action ion spectroscopy}.

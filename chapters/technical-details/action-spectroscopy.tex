\section{Action spectroscopy}

Gas-phase action spectroscopic techniques of vibrational and rotational transitions for highly reactive molecular ions are discussed in more detail in Section \ref{sec:action-spectroscopy}. In this thesis work, the characterisation of molecular ion for vibrational modes are recorded using Infrared predissociation (IRPD) spectroscopy and pure-rotational transitions modes are measured using a novel action spectroscopic method called \textbf{RO}tational \textbf{S}tate-dependent \textbf{A}ttachment of rare gas \textbf{A}toms (ROSAA). Both of these action spectroscopic techniques are described in detail in the following sections.

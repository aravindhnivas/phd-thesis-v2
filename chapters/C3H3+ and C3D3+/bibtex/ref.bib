abstract = {The ion-molecule chemistry of C3H3+is systematically investigated with a series of alkenes, alkynes, and aromatic molecules under low-pressure, room temperature conditions. Based upon their reactivity differences, two C3H3+structures are distinguished and are assigned as the cyclic (the most stable) and linear isomers. Cyclic C3H3+readily reacts with unsaturated compounds having four or more carbon atoms. Linear C3H3+is found to be even more reactive and, in particular, forms condensation products with acetylene and benzene. The relevance of these results for the higher temperature and atmospheric pressure conditions of a flame environment is discussed. Since C3H3+has been found to be the dominant positive ion for rich and sooting hydrocarbon flames, its high reactivity provides a rapid first step in the ion models of soot formation. {\textcopyright} 1982, Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Here we argue that the distinct peak observed at mass 39 AMU is due to the aromatic cation C3H3+ (cyclopropenyl). Laboratory mass spec-troscopy of unsaturated hydrocarbon-chain molecules and aromatics yields large intensities of mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 39; the spectra of the aromatic molecules also indicate the presence of C4H3+ (m/z =51) and C5H5+ (m/z =65). These latter products are not seen in the PICCA data, suggesting that in the cometary environment unsaturated hydrocarbon chains predominate over aromatics. We suggest that the progenitor of the hydrocarbon chains (which are apparently the parents of the C3H3+ ion) are the 'CHON' dust particles observed around the comet3; the C3H3+ ion may also be one of the parent molecules of C3, which is a common feature of cometary spectra4, although its origin has remained obscure.},

abstract = {The recent measurements by Cassini Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) showed the presence of numerous carbocations and shed light on their composition in Titan's upper atmosphere. The present research identifies an important class of ion-molecule reactions proceeding via carbocation collision complexes, and its implications in the chemistry of Titan's thermosphere and ionosphere. An analysis (based on the kinetics and dynamics of the elementary chemical processes identified) of the Cassini measurements reveals the mechanism of formation of the three-membered Huckel aromatic rings- Cyclopropenyl cation and its cyclic methyl derivatives. For carbocations, a nonclassical three-carbon- center two-electron-bond structure is no longer a controversial topic in chemistry literature. Emphasis has been placed on a future coordinated effort of state-of-the-art laboratory experiments, quantum- chemical calculations, and astronomical ALMA and JWST observations including planetary in situ measurements at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths to elucidate the structure, energetics and dynamics of the compositions of carbocations detected by Cassini cationic mass spectrometry. The carbocation chemistry in Titan's upper atmosphere has a possible bearing on the organic chemistry and aromaticity in the atmosphere of primitive earth. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The FA-SIFT experiment at Canterbury was used to determine some of the principal termolecular ion-molecule reactions that occur in the atmosphere of Titan, Saturn's satellite. The experiments were performed using both a pure nitrogen bath gas and a pure helium bath gas. The reactions of the ions N+, N2+, N3+, N4+, HCNH+, c-C3H3+, and H3O+ with molecular nitrogen were studied in a nitrogen bath gas at room temperature. Only two of these ions, N+ and N2+, were observed to react with N2, forming N3+ and N4+, respectively. A second set of experiments was performed that measured the reactivity of ions in Titan's atmosphere that do not undergo rapid bimolecular reactions with other species. The reactions of these so-called "terminal" ions (HCNH+, c-C3H3+, and H3O+) with the trace neutral constituents of Titan (CH4, C2H2, and C2H4) were also examined using both helium and nitrogen as the bath gas. The only reactions observed to occur were the termolecular reactions of HCNH+ and H3O+ with C2H2 and C2H4. A third set of reactions was studied. These were the reactions of N3+ and N4+ with the species CH4, C2H2, C2H4, HCN, and C4H8. All of the reactions in this third set have bimolecular ion-molecule kinetics, and they are compared in the text with the similar reactions of N+ and N2+ with these reagents. Finally, a projection is made using a model temperature and pressure profile of Titan's atmosphere to appraise the relative importance of N+ vs N3+ reactions and N2+ vs N4+ reactions. {\textcopyright} 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {The intermolecular interaction and microsolvation process of isomeric C3H3+ ions in molecular nitrogen are characterized by infrared (IR) photodissociation spectroscopy of C3H3+-(N2)n complexes (n=1-6) and quantum chemical calculations (n=0-4). The rovibrational analysis of the C3H3+-N2 spectrum unambiguously reveals the presence of (at least) two C3H3+ isomers in the ion source, namely the propargyl (H2CCCH+) and the cyclopropenyl (c-C3H3+) cations. Analysis of the cluster size-dependent vibrational frequency shifts and splittings, the photofragmentation branching ratios, and the results of density functional calculations provides a consistent picture of the microsolvation of c-C3H3+ and H2CCCH+ in inert nitrogen. In the most stable c-C3H3+-(N2)n complexes, the first three N2 ligands form (nearly) linear and equivalent proton bonds to the three protons of c-C3H3+, leading to highly symmetric planar structures with C2v (n=1, 2) and D3h symmetry (n=3). After completion of this first solvation subshell at n=3, further N2 ligands form weaker intermolecular bonds to the C atoms of the nearly planar c-C3H3+-(N2)3 ion core. The dissociation energies of the H-bonds and C-bonds in c-C3H3+-(N2)n are estimated as D0(H)=900±130cm-1 and D0(C)=860±170cm-1, respectively. In the most stable H2CCCH+-N2 complex, the N2 ligand forms a linear ionic H-bond to the acetylenic C-H group of H2CCCH+, leading to a planar structure with C2v symmetry. The calculations suggest that the next two ligands bind to the protons of the CH2 group giving rise to planar structures with Cs (n=2) and C2v symmetry (n=3), and these structures are compatible with the observed IR spectra. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {C3H3+ ions produced with a pulsed discharge source and cooled in a supersonic beam are studied with infrared laser photodissociation spectroscopy in the 800-4000 cm-1 region using the rare gas tagging method. Vibrational bands in the C-H stretching and fingerprint regions confirm the presence of both the cyclopropenyl and propargyl cations. Because there is a high barrier separating these two structures, they are presumed to be produced by different routes in the plasma chemistry; their relative abundance can be adjusted by varying the ion source conditions. Prominent features for the cyclopropenyl species include the asymmetric carbon stretch ($\nu$5) at 1293 cm-1 and the asymmetric C-H stretch ($\nu$4) at 3182 cm-1, whereas propargyl has the CH2 scissors (4) at 1445, the C-C triple bond stretch ($\nu$3) at 2077 and three C-H stretches ($\nu$2, $\nu$9, and $\nu$1) at 3004, 3093, and 3238 cm-1. Density functional theory computations of vibrational spectra for the two isomeric ions with and without the argon tag reproduce the experimental features qualitatively; according to theory the tag atom only perturbs the spectra slightly. Although these data confirm the accepted structural pictures of the cyclopropenyl and propargyl cations, close agreement between theoretical predictions and the measured vibrational band positions and intensities cannot be obtained. Band intensities are influenced by the energy dependence and dynamics of photodissociation, but there appear to be fundamental problems in computed band positions independent of the level of theory employed. These new data provide infrared signatures in the fingerprint region for these prototypical carbocations that may aid in their astrophysical detection. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

At least two C3H3+ isomers are generated by electron impact ionization of allene (H2CCCH2) in the cluster ion source, namely the cyclopropenyl (c-C3H3+) and propargyl (H2CCCH+) cations. Both C3H3+ ions form weakly-bound adducts with all ligands considered and the attraction in these ion-ligand complexes is dominated by induction and electrostatic forces. In general, the intermolecular interaction in both c-C3H3+-L and H2CCCH+-L increases in the order Ne{\textless}Ar{\textless}O2{\textless}N2{\textless}CO2, in line with the polarizabilities, quadrupole moments, and proton affinities) of L. Rovibrational analysis of the $\nu$4 vibrations of c-C3H3+-L involving molecular ligands reveals several competing structural binding motifs, including the formation of H-bonds (L = N2, CO2, O2), C-bonds (L = CO2, and $\pi$-bonds (L = O2). The preferred binding site and details of the equilibrium structure strongly depend on L. In contrast, the observed H2CCCH+-L dimers feature all H-bonds between L and the acetylenic proton. Ab initio calculations for c-C3H3+-L and H2CCCH+-L at the MP2(full)/6-311G(2df,2pd) level provide additional information about the intermolecular potential energy surface of these ion-ligand complexes and confirm the interpretation of the experimental IR spectra. Photofragmentation branching ratios observed for (c-C3H3+-(CO2)n with n = 1-3 allow the dissociation energy of the intermolecular H-bonds and C-bonds to be estimated as D0(H/C) = 1300±300 cm-1.},

In particular, the bands observed in the range 3238-3245 cm-1 (D. Roth and O. Dopfer, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.4, 4855, 2002) are assigned to essentially free acetylenic CH stretching vibrations of the propargyl cation in "C-bound" H2C3H+{\textperiodcentered}L complexes. {\textcopyright} the Owner Societies 2011.},

@article{Craig1986,
abstract = {Infrared and Raman spectra of the four hydrogen-deuterium isotopomers of the cyclopropenyl cation, C3H3+, C3D3+, C3H2D+, and C3D2H+, have been recorded. A virtually complete assignment has been made of the spectroscopically active, in-plane fundamentals of the set of four ions. Assignments for the out-of-plane vibrational modes are fragmentary. For the C3H3+ ion, the frequencies (cm-1) are as follows: a1' 3183, 1626; a2' (1031); e' 3138, 1290, 927; a2” 758; e” (990), where the values in parentheses are from normal coordinate calculations. A complete, general-valence force Field of 12 constants has been fitted to the set of 31 observed frequencies. Force constants for CC stretching (7.890 mdyn {\AA}-1), CH stretching (5.284 mdyn {\AA}-1), and CH in-plane bending (0.599 mdyn {\AA} rad-2) are each larger than the corresponding force constants for benzene. The large force constant for CC stretching implies that the cyclopropenyl cation has exceptionally strong $\pi$-bonding. {\textcopyright} 1986, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

@article{Breslow1970,
abstract = {Three salts of cyclopropenyl cation (I) have been prepared from 3-chlorocyclopropene. The nmr spectrum of the cation is consistent with expectations, and the infrared spectrum has only four bands which have been assigned to the four allowed modes for a molecule with D3h symmetry. The PKR+ of I was determined to be –7.4 ± 0.1 by an nmr method. Comparison with an estimated pKR+ for allyl cation shows that I is 18 kcal/mole more stabilized. This compares well with a gas-phase value of 17–18 kcal/mole determined from appearance potentials. {\textcopyright} 1970, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

@article{Garcia2018,
abstract = {We present the photoelectron spectra of C3Hx (x = 0-3) formed in a microwave discharge flow-tube reactor by consecutive H abstractions from C3H4 (C3Hx + F → C3Hx-1 + HF (x = 1-4)), but also from F + CH4 schemes by secondary reactions. The spectra were obtained combining tunable VUV synchrotron radiation with double imaging electron/ion coincidence techniques, yielding mass-selected threshold photoelectron spectra. The obtained results complement not only existing ones, but for the first time the photoelectron spectra of C3, cyclic and linear C3H (c,l-C3H) as well as of the excited states of C3H3 are reported. In the case of c-C3H, l,t-C3H2 and C3H3, Franck-Condon simulations have been performed in order to assign the vibrational structure. The adiabatic ionization energies of these radicals are reported and compared to ab initio calculated values as well as to theoretical values using known enthalpies of formation.},

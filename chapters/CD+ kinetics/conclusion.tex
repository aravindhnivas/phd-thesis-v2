\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:CD+_conclusion}

We have reported a detailed systematic analysis on the ternary attachment reaction of \CD with He atoms. A kinetic measurement in the presence of resonant radiation to derive a rotational-state-specific $k_3$ is illustrated. All together this helps us to investigate the ROSAA signal intensity of pure rotational spectra via a numerical simulation model. 
% Consequently validating our model and extending it to study other systems are discussed.
A complete simulation overview of the model, i.e., function of time, number density, power and $k_3$ ratio is reported and analysed for the \CDline rotational transition of the \CD molecular ion. Furthermore, reaction of the N$^+$ ion with helium atoms is investigated. The temperature dependence of $k_3$ and $k_{CID}$ are discussed for \CD, and N$^+$ reactions with He at low temperatures, i.e., T$_{trap}<10$ K.

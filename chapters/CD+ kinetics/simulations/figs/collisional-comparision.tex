    \caption{(a) Collisional process for \CD ions up to $J=5$ with He buffer gas ([He]$=2.2 \cdot 10^{14}$ \percc). The coloured label indicates the corresponding \CD$(J)$ state. At $t=0$, T$_{coll}=300$ K, at which the relative population corresponds to a Boltzmann distribution at 300 K. The relative population evolves through collisions with He with rate constants for T$_{coll}=7$ K (derived from \cite{Werfelli2017}), subsequently reaching equilibrium after $<0.5$ ms. (b) Comparison of the Boltzmann distribution at 7 K with the relative population involving only collisional process (Coll.) at $t=1$ ms.}

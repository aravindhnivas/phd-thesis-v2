    \caption{Relative population of rotational energy levels ($J$) from the numerical simulation at the time ($t$) indicated under the caption. The simulation conditions are as follows: T$_{coll}=7$ K, $a=0.5$, Helium number density $2.2 \cdot 10^{14}$ \percc\ and radiation power $3.5\cdot10^{-5}$ W. Different process are colour coded and labelled in (a), are compared with Boltzmann distribution (black solid line) at T$_{coll}=7$ K.  The labels indicate the following process as only collisional (Coll.), collisional process with He attachment (Coll. + Att.) and Rad. indicates the presence of a radiative process, Coll. $\ll$ Rad. indicates that the radiative process rates are much larger ($>10^{5}$ higher) than collisional rates.}

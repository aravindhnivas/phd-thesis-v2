    \caption{Simulated relative rotational level populations for \CD and corresponding number He$_n$\CD clusters (n=1, 2) as labelled in (top right) and \CD$(J)$ indicates \CD in $J$ rotational state. The simulation conditions are as follows: $k_{3_1}$ ratio, $a=0.5$, collisional rates for T$_{coll}=7$ K  (at $t=0$, T$_{coll}=300$ K), Helium number density $2.2 \cdot 10^{14}$ \percc and radiation power $3.5\cdot10^{-5}$ W. The solid and dashed lines correspond to, with (-ON) and without (--OFF), the presence of radiation for \CD \CDline transition.}

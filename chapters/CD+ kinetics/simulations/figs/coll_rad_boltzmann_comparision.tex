    \caption{(a) Simulated relative rotational level populations for \CD as labelled in parenthesis. The population evolves from $t=0$ (T$_{coll}=300$ K) to reach equilibrium at $t<0.5$ ms. The solid and dashed lineshapes correspond with (ON) and without (OFF) the presence of radiation for \CD \CDline transition. The radiation power is $35\ \mu$ W. (b) Compares the Boltzmann distribution at 7 K with the relative population involving only collisional process (Coll.) and, collision and radiative process (Coll. + Rad.) at $t=1$ ms.}

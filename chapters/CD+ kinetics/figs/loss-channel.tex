    \caption{Fitting of the experimental kinetics scans to the rate equation model: (a) is with both $R_{loss}$ and $R_{loss30}$ channels included while (b) is only with $R_{loss30}$. (c) and (d) are zoomed-in regions for (a) and (b), respectively. The measurements were carried out at 6.9(3) K and  $1.770(45) \cdot 10^{14}$ \percc\ helium number density. No higher order complexes were formed other than mass 30, which most probably is DCO$^+$ as described in Eq. \ref{eqn:mass-30-reaction-with-CO2} and \ref{eqn:mass-30-reaction-with-water}}

The measurement for (a) were carried out at 6.9(3) K and  $1.770(45) \cdot 10^{14}$ \percc helium number density. To compare the effect of including extra trap loss channel, $R_{loss30}$  (b) and (c) are shown, without and with trap loss channel respectively measured at 4.8(3) K and $6.04(25) \cdot 10^{14}$ \percc number density.}

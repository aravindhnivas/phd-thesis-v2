\section{Influence of radiation}
\label{subsec:rate-constants-laserOn}

Following the main motivation of this chapter (Section
\ref{sec:CD+-kinetics-motivation}), in this section, the \CD + He reaction
kinetics under the influence of radiation (\CD, $J=0-1$ transition) will be
discussed.

The measurement of the pure rotational $J=0-1$ line of \CD has been previously
studied by employing the ROSAA action spectroscopic method and numerical
simulations \cite{kluge_state-selective_2016, Brunken2017}. In the present study, an
improved numerical simulation model has been implemented (see Section
\ref{subsec:ROSAA-simulation}) that employs the numerically stable implicit
Runge-Kutta ODE solver for stiff equations instead of an explicit Euler approach,
\CD + He collisional rate coefficients \cite{Werfelli2017} instead of derived
rate coefficients from the CH$^+$ + He reaction, and that includes spontaneous
emission on all involved energy states. As a result, a more adaptable program
has been developed for general-purpose numerical kinetics models with an
easy-to-use graphical user interface. Additionally, the \CD \CDline rotational
transition is measured using neon atoms as collision and association partner,
allowing the use of a higher temperature range (up to 14 K) which shows us the
possibility of using Ne atoms for ROSAA measurement of energetically
higher-lying rotational transitions.

Figure \ref{fig:thz} shows the measured \CD rotational spectrum using both He-
and Ne-attachment for the ROSAA method fitted with various lineshapes such as Gaussian,
Lorentz and Voigt. The experiment is repeated with various temperatures and
over large pressure ranges as summarized in Table \ref{tab:CD+_He} and
\ref{tab:CD+_Ne} with fitted parameters such as central transition frequency,
signal intensity (He\CD depletion \%) and full-width half maxima (FWHM). The
measured $J=0-1$ transition frequency fitted with a Voigt profile line shape is
453521.852(5) MHz via He-ROSAA and 453521.853(5) MHz via Ne-ROSAA,
respectively, and agrees well within the respective error bars with each other
and with the previous literature value 453521.8509(7) and 453521.8530(6) MHz
via He-ROSAA by \citet{Brunken2017} and \citet{domenech_first_2018},
respectively, and with an earlier absorption study in a glow discharge experiment 453521.851(20) MHz by
\citet{amano_j_2010}.

\subsection{Determining ion temperature}
\label{subsec:CD+-Tion}

The ion temperature (T$_{ion}$) can be determined from a measured line profile
fitted with a Voigt lineshape (see Section
\ref{subsec:collisional-ion-temperature} for detail). Figure \ref{fig:Tcoll}
shows a plot comparing measured nominal trap temperature, T$_{trap}$ and
derived T$_{ion}$ for \CD from Table \ref{tab:CD+_He} and \ref{tab:CD+_Ne}.
The plot is compared with the previously determined values in the FELion
instrument by \citet{kluge_state-selective_2016}. This confirms that the ion
temperature is higher than the nominal trap temperatures, as observed
previously in the 22-pole ion trap \cite{asvany_numerical_2009, otto_internal_2013, endres_incomplete_2017}. 
For T$_{trap} < 5$ and $>5$ K, the corresponding T$_{ion}$ are derived from He-ROSAA and Ne-ROSAA
measurements, respectively. Each data point in Figure \ref{fig:Tcoll} is an averaged value
of the corresponding T$_{ion}$ derived from at least two measurements of FWHM as shown in Table \ref{tab:CD+_He} 
and \ref{tab:CD+_Ne}. The large uncertainty of the T$_{ion}$ value in our measurement is because of the
large uncertainty in the derived FWHM from the measured line profiles (see Table \ref{tab:CD+_He} and \ref{tab:CD+_Ne}).
However, the trend of T$_{ion}$ with T$_{trap}$ is consistent with the previous measurements.

\input{chapters/CD+ kinetics/figs/figure_deriving_Tcoll}
Our measured \Tion data is higher than the previous literature data (see Figure \ref{fig:Tcoll}). However, different experimental conditions could explain this difference. Since, as discussed by \citet{endres_incomplete_2017}, various factors such as RF heating, buffer gas thermalisation with trap walls, black-body radiation from the surrounding room temperature vacuum chamber, and collision with warm residual gas that enters the cryogenic trap, in principle, can influence the ion temperature.

% The measurements are performed at $\sim 35\ \mu$W for \CD $J=0-1$ transition.
% Similar to deriving T$_{ion}$, one could also derive the power from the Lorentzian parameters using equation \ref{eqn:fL}. However, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:thz}, the Gaussian part dominates and, thus, the Lorentzian parameters and, subsequently, the power could not be determined within reasonable error limits.
% maybe include this in the discussion later ?
% The \Tion dependency for \CD on the ion-to-buffer gas mass ratio, i.e., for He
% and Ne, could not be determined in this study. However,
% \citet{endres_incomplete_2017} showed that for OH$^-$, \Tion is independent
% of the ion-to-buffer gas mass ratio using He and HD. 
The number density variation in the range $(2-6) \cdot 10^{14}$ \percc\ around 5 K temperature
for helium (see Table \ref{tab:CD+_He}) did not influence the derived T$_{ion}$
within the error limits. The effective collisional temperature, i.e., T$_{coll}$, is derived from \Ttrap
and \Tion using equation \ref{eqn:Tcoll}. The following sections
investigate the kinetic measurement in the presence of radiation and ROSAA
simulations at a given collisional temperature.


\subsection{Kinetics}
\label{subsec:CD+-kinetics}

The measured formation rate constants ($k_3$) in kinetic experiments are 
weighted average rate coefficients over the thermal population of rotational
levels ($J$) at a given collisional temperature (T$_{coll}$). The rotational
state-specific ternary rate constants ($k_{3_1}$) for the first attachment process can be written as:
\begin{equation}
    k_{3_1} (T_{coll}) = \frac{\sum_{J} k_{3_1} (J, \text{T}_{coll}) \cdot N_{\text{CD}^+ (J)} }{N_{\text{CD}^+}}
    \label{eqn:rate-constant-weighted}
\end{equation}

where $N_{\text{CD}^+ (J)}$ indicate the thermal population at a specific rotational $J$ level 
and $N_{\text{CD}^+}$ is the total population of \CD ion on all $J$ levels.\\

\input{chapters/CD+ kinetics/figs/on-rate-constant_1-funcOf_nHe.tex}
Figure \ref{fig:on:effective-and-ternary} shows the He\CD formation rate
coefficient as described in equation \ref{eqn:rate-constant-weighted}. The
formation rate coefficients ($k_{3_1}$) for the first complex (HeCD$^+$) measured with and without the presence of radiation resonant with the $J=0-1$ transition of \CD ion is denoted by $k_{3_1}(ON)$ and
$k_{3_1}(OFF)$, respectively (see Figure \ref{fig:off:rate-constants} and \ref{fig:on:rate-constants}).

The derived rate constants at T$_{coll}=7$ K and P$=3.5\times 10^{-5}$ W, is given by:
\begin{align}
    \label{eqn:k-on-off}
    \begin{split}
        k_{3_1}(OFF) &= 1.1(1) \cdot 10^{-30} \text{ cm}^6/\text{s}\\
        k_{3_1}(ON) &= 7.8(8) \cdot 10^{-31} \text{ cm}^6/\text{s}
    \end{split}
\end{align}

Following the discussion from Section \ref{subsec:ROSAA-simulation}, the
state-dependent formation rate constant is the key factor in understanding the
ROSAA process and, subsequently, its signal intensity (referred to as depletion
counts [\%] in Figure \ref{fig:thz}). The next section discusses this
relationship in detail with numerical simulations.

  abstract     = {The recent measurements by Cassini Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) showed the presence of numerous carbocations and shed light on their composition in Titan's upper atmosphere. The present research identifies an important class of ion-molecule reactions proceeding via carbocation collision complexes, and its implications in the chemistry of Titan's thermosphere and ionosphere. An analysis (based on the kinetics and dynamics of the elementary chemical processes identified) of the Cassini measurements reveals the mechanism of formation of the three-membered Huckel aromatic rings- Cyclopropenyl cation and its cyclic methyl derivatives. For carbocations, a nonclassical three-carbon- center two-electron-bond structure is no longer a controversial topic in chemistry literature. Emphasis has been placed on a future coordinated effort of state-of-the-art laboratory experiments, quantum- chemical calculations, and astronomical ALMA and JWST observations including planetary in situ measurements at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths to elucidate the structure, energetics and dynamics of the compositions of carbocations detected by Cassini cationic mass spectrometry. The carbocation chemistry in Titan's upper atmosphere has a possible bearing on the organic chemistry and aromaticity in the atmosphere of primitive earth. {©} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract     = {The unidentified infrared emission features ({UIR} bands) are attributed to a collection of partially hydrogenated, positively charged polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ({PAHs}). This assignment is based on a spectroscopic analysis of the {UIR} bands. Comparison of the observed interstellar 6.2 and 7.7-micron bands with the laboratory measured Raman spectrum of a collection of carbon-based particulates (auto exhaust) shows a very good agreement, supporting this identification. The infrared emission is due to relaxation from highly vibrationally and electronically excited states. The excitation is probably caused by {UV} photon absorption. The infrared fluorescence of one particular, highly vibrationally excited {PAH} (chrysene) is modeled. In this analysis the species is treated as a molecule rather than bulk material and the non-thermodynamic equilibrium nature of the emission is fully taken into account. From a comparison of the observed ratio of the 3.3 to 11.3-micron {UIR} bands with the model calculations, the average number of carbon atoms per molecule is estimated to be about 20. The abundance of interstellar {PAHs} is calculated to be about 2 x 10 to the -7th with respect to hydrogen.},

  abstract  = {This chapter introduces an approach to basis set design— that is, to use physically motivated atomic orbitals as basis functions for molecular calculations. The fact that the {AOs} are expanded as fixed contractions of Gaussian functions is a physically irrelevant computational device. For correlated calculations, the natural orbitals derived from correlated atomic wave functions prove to be a compact, computationally efficient, and physically meaningful set of basis functions. The efficient evaluation of {AO} integrals over such basis sets imposes certain computational requirements on an integral code. The chapter discusses how these requirements are implemented in evaluation of two-electron integrals over a generally contracted Gaussian basis set in the molecule integral program. The chapter also discusses how {ANO} basis sets are effectively able to exhaust the capabilities of the underlying Gaussian expansion basis— that is, to minimize the contraction error. Finally, the chapter describes several applications of quantum chemistry to problems in which the use of {ANO} basis sets is significant in obtaining the required high accuracy.},

The unexpectedly large Zeeman effect and the spin-rotation hyperfine interaction for a 1Σ molecule are observed. The Zeeman effect and the hyperfine interaction appear to be distinctively different for each isotopic species.

  abstract     = {{Methyl cyanide (CH3CN) and propyne (CH3CCH) are two molecules commonly used as gas thermometers for interstellar gas. They are detected in several astrophysical environments and in particular towards protostars. Using data of the low-mass protostar IRAS 16293–2422 obtained with the IRAM 30-m single-dish telescope, we constrained the origin of these two molecules in the envelope of the source. The line shape comparison and the results of a radiative transfer analysis both indicate that the emission of CH3CN arises from a warmer and inner region of the envelope than the CH3CCH emission. We compare the observational results with the predictions of a gas-grain chemical model. Our model predicts a peak abundance of CH3CCH in the gas-phase in the outer part of the envelope, at around 2000 au from the central star, which is relatively close to the emission size derived from the observations. The predicted CH3CN abundance only rises at the radius where the grain mantle ices evaporate, with an abundance similar to the one derived from the observations.}},

  abstract     = {The FA-SIFT experiment at Canterbury was used to determine some of the principal termolecular ion-molecule reactions that occur in the atmosphere of Titan, Saturn's satellite. The experiments were performed using both a pure nitrogen bath gas and a pure helium bath gas. The reactions of the ions N+, N2+, N3+, N4+, HCNH+, c-C3H3+, and H3O+ with molecular nitrogen were studied in a nitrogen bath gas at room temperature. Only two of these ions, N+ and N2+, were observed to react with N2, forming N3+ and N4+, respectively. A second set of experiments was performed that measured the reactivity of ions in Titan's atmosphere that do not undergo rapid bimolecular reactions with other species. The reactions of these so-called "terminal" ions (HCNH+, c-C3H3+, and H3O+) with the trace neutral constituents of Titan (CH4, C2H2, and C2H4) were also examined using both helium and nitrogen as the bath gas. The only reactions observed to occur were the termolecular reactions of HCNH+ and H3O+ with C2H2 and C2H4. A third set of reactions was studied. These were the reactions of N3+ and N4+ with the species CH4, C2H2, C2H4, HCN, and C4H8. All of the reactions in this third set have bimolecular ion-molecule kinetics, and they are compared in the text with the similar reactions of N+ and N2+ with these reagents. Finally, a projection is made using a model temperature and pressure profile of Titan's atmosphere to appraise the relative importance of N+ vs N3+ reactions and N2+ vs N4+ reactions. {©} 2000 Academic Press.},

As a first experimental test in one of them, {CH}5+and H3O+ ions have been trapped in the presence of helium gas at 3.8 K and the kinetics and temperature dependence of He tagging investigated. A first shell closure with 5 and (3 + 2) attached He atoms, respectively, is observed for both species. Applying {IR} radiation in the 3 μm region, helium attachment to {CH}5+is hindered by exciting {CH}-stretches of {CH}5+prior to attachment. The resulting spectroscopic signal shows that the kinetic temperature of the stored {CH}5+ensemble is below 12 K.},

These are the first pure rotational spectra of molecular ions by action spectroscopy. For this purpose, a cryogenic multipole ion trap has been combined with narrow-band tunable radiation sources operating in the 1.25 to 1.53THz range. The low temperature of the ions allows us to determine the astronomically important transitions with a relative precision of Δν/ν=10-8. While the 1476605.708(15){MHz} line center frequency for the o-D2H+ transition agrees very well with previous unpublished work, the 1370084.880(20){MHz} line center frequency for the p-H2D+ transition deviates by 61MHz.

  abstract     = {Rotational action spectroscopy is an experimental method in which rotational spectra of molecules, typically in the microwave to sub-mm-wave domain of the electromagnetic spectrum (∼1-1000 {GHz}), are recorded by action spectroscopy. Action spectroscopy means that the spectrum is recorded not by detecting the absorption of light by the molecules, but by the action of the light on the molecules, e.g., photon-induced dissociation of a chemical bond, a photon-triggered reaction, or photodetachment of an electron. Typically, such experiments are performed on molecular ions, which can be well controlled and mass-selected by guiding and storage techniques. Though coming with many advantages, the application of action schemes to rotational spectroscopy was hampered for a long time by the small energy content of a corresponding photon. Therefore, the first rotational action spectroscopic methods emerged only about one decade ago. Today, there exists a toolbox full of different rotational action spectroscopic schemes which are summarized in this review.},

  abstract     = {Analysis of Adams' visual estimates indicates that the interstellar lines {CH}+ x 4232 and {CH} x 4300 originate in two types of regions-in the normal obscuring clouds responsible for selective extinction and in circumstellar clouds near stars of late B types. In stars of types 0 and early B, the intensities of X 4232 and N 4300 are closely correlated with color excess, E1 the mean particle densities of these molecules, averaged over the volume in and between the clouds, is about 10-8 . Among stars of later B types, many unreddened stars (E1 0.05) show strong molecular lines; the number of molecules per square centimeter in the line of sight averages about 3 X 10 cm for types B2-B5. Of fifteen unreddened stars showing the molecular lines, the velocity difference, interstellar minus stellar lines, is positive in all but one case. A theoretical analysis shows that many of the rate coefficients affecting the equilibrium abundance of {CH} and {CH}+ molecules have different values from those assumed hitherto. In particular, the formation of {CH} by radiative association is markedly slower than previously believed, and there is some possibility that dissociative recombination ({CH}+ + e H C + H) is very rapid. If best estimates are adopted for all the rate coefficients, the observed molecular densities can be explained only if the clouds are extremely concentrated, with a central density no(H) of neutral H about 10 . If, however, the f-value for {CH} N 4300 is increased by a factor of 30 above the theoretical figure, an increase for which there is some observational evidence, agreement is obtained with no(H) equal to about 80. Mternatively, the molecules may be formed at the surface of the grains. The molecules observed in circumstellar clouds may originate from the sublimation of {CH}4 from the grains, a process which should occur when the internal temperature of the grains rises much above some 25 K. The {CH}4 molecules will dissociate, forming a hemispherical shell of {CH}+ molecules on the side of the star from which the cloud is advancing. This hypothesis explains why the circumstellar molecular lines in an unreddened star show a greater radial velocity than do the stellar lines, and quantitative agreement with the number of observed {CH}+ molecules is obtained with reasonable values for the unfortunately rather uncertain physical parameters. However, once again, agreement with the observed abundance of {CH} can be obtained only if the f-value for N 4300 is taken to be 30 times that indicated by quantal calculation.},

From the analysis of the spectroscopic data recorded at varying experimental conditions, e.g. over a wide range of He number densities and excitation powers, we deduce that the ternary rate coefficient in the first excited rotational state of {CD}+ is reduced to (55±5)\% of the rotational ground state value. This decrease in the rate coefficient can be rationalized as an increase of the redissociation probability in the ternary collision process. A summary of rotational spectroscopy measurements of other molecular ions using the new method will be given, and its general applicability is discussed.},

Two bands at 9,632 ångströms and 9,577 ångströms were reported in 1994, and were suggested to arise from C60+ molecules (ref. 3), on the basis of the proximity of these wavelengths to the absorption bands of C60+ measured in a neon matrix. Confirmation of this assignment requires the gas-phase spectrum of C60+. Here we report laboratory spectroscopy of C60+ in the gas phase, cooled to 5.8 kelvin. The absorption spectrum has maxima at 9,632.7 ± 0.1 ångströms and 9,577.5 ± 0.1 ångströms, and the full widths at half-maximum of these bands are 2.2 ± 0.2 ångströms and 2.5 ± 0.2 ångströms, respectively.

  abstract     = {Ionization and fragmentation pathways induced by ionizing agents are key to understanding the formation of complex molecules in astrophysical environments. Acetonitrile (CH 3 CN), the simplest organic nitrile, is an important molecule present in the interstellar medium. In this work, DFT and MP2 calculations were performed in order to obtain the low energy structures of the most relevant cations formed from electron-stimulated ion desorption of CH 3 CN ices. Selected reaction pathways and spectroscopic properties were also calculated. Our results indicate that the most stable acetonitrile cation structure is CH 2 CNH + and that hydro-genation can occur successively without isomerization steps until its complete saturation. Moreover, the stability of distinct cluster families formed from the interaction of acetonitrile with small fragments, such as CH n + , C 2 H n + , and CH n CNH + , is discussed in terms of their respective binding energies. Some of these molecular clusters are stabilized by hydrogen bonds, leading to species whose infrared features are characterized by a strong redshift of the N− H stretching mode. Finally, the rotational spectra of CH 3 CN and protonated acetonitrile, CH 3 CNH + , were simulated using distinct computational protocols based on DFT, MP2, and CCSD(T) considering centrifugal distortion, vibrational−rotational coupling, and vibrational anharmonicity corrections. By adopting an empirical scaling procedure for calculating spectroscopic parameters, we were able to estimate the rotational frequencies of CH 3 CNH + with an expected average error below 1 MHz for J values up to 10.},

  abstract     = {Infrared and Raman spectra of the four hydrogen-deuterium isotopomers of the cyclopropenyl cation, C3H3+, C3D3+, C3H2D+, and C3D2H+, have been recorded. A virtually complete assignment has been made of the spectroscopically active, in-plane fundamentals of the set of four ions. Assignments for the out-of-plane vibrational modes are fragmentary. For the C3H3+ ion, the frequencies (cm-1) are as follows: a1' 3183, 1626; a2' (1031); e' 3138, 1290, 927; a2” 758; e” (990), where the values in parentheses are from normal coordinate calculations. A complete, general-valence force Field of 12 constants has been fitted to the set of 31 observed frequencies. Force constants for CC stretching (7.890 mdyn {Å}-1), CH stretching (5.284 mdyn {Å}-1), and CH in-plane bending (0.599 mdyn {Å} rad-2) are each larger than the corresponding force constants for benzene. The large force constant for CC stretching implies that the cyclopropenyl cation has exceptionally strong $\pi$-bonding. {©} 1986, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {Calculations have been performed to determine the abundance ratio of the metastable isomer CH 3 NC to the stable isomer CH 3 CN in dense interstellar clouds. According to gas phase, ion-molecule treatments, these molecules are both synthesized via protonated ion precursors. We have calculated the ratio of the formation rates of the protonated precursor ions-CH 3 NCH + and CH 3 CNH +-synthesized via the radiative association reaction between CH3 and HCN, which is thought to be the dominant formation process of the two isomeric ions. Our calculations, which involve both ab initio quantum chemistry and equilibrium determinations, lead to a predicted CH 3 NCH + /CH3CNH + formation rate ratio between 0.1 and 0.4. If this ratio is maintained in the neutral species formed from the precursor ions, theory predicts a sizable abundance for methyl isocyanide (CH3NC) and lends credence to its tentative observation.},

  abstract   = {This chapter discusses the ways to develop techniques to isolate, contain in a trap, thermalize, and possibly refrigerate the atomic systems under observation. The electrons move along bound orbits that are characterized by three frequencies. In ultrahigh vacuums, a beam of low-energy electrons is reflected upon itself. Temporary trapping occurs by the transformation of longitudinal kinetic energy into transverse because of e–e collisions. By providing simultaneously a radiative damping mechanism, the trapping is made permanent. Because ion–ion collisions cannot transform energy of the motion of the center of mass into the kinetic energy of the relative motion of the ions, no energy absorption from the field can take place. The ions having been formed by fast ions passing on their charge to thermal atoms may, independent of the collision parameter, be assumed to be initially at rest in good approximation. No energy input into the self-regenerating ion cloud occurs because of the collision process.},

Spectra are reported for Fe+({CO}2)n complexes that demonstrate the formation of coordination spheres around the metal cation and for Mg+({CO}2)n complexes, where the interaction with theory makes it possible to obtain structures for small clusters. Both of these studies investigate the asymmetric stretch region of {CO}2. Ni+(C2H2)n complexes are studied in the C-H stretch region, demonstrating evidence for intracluster cyclization reactions. Finally, experiments are described for metal ion-benzene (M = V, Al) complexes excited in the benzene ring distortions and C-H bending region. These experiments confirm the -bonded configuration of these complexes.},

  abstract     = {1. The title of this lecture naturally provokes the question, Is there any appreciable quantity of matter in ordinary regions of space between the stars ? I admit that it is rather an important question, and I should scarcely feel justified in devoting a Bakerian lecture to the subject if I did not think the answer was in the affirmative. But from the narrower astronomical point of view it is not a question to be insisted on at the outset. Astronomers are, in fact, so placed that they must presume the existence of such matter unless or until its absence is proved. For many years interstellar matter has figured in astronomical investigations, but chiefly with a negative importance. Three examples may be given— (1) In determining spectroscopic parallaxes and in gauging the distances of clusters and spiral nebulae by means of Cepheid variables it is assumed that there is no absorption or scattering of light by interstellar matter.},

For most of these applications it is important to know the translational and internal temperatures of the trapped ions. Here, we present detailed rotational state thermometry measurements over an extended temperature range for hydroxyl anions in He, {HD}, and H2. The measured rotational temperatures show a termination of the thermalisation with the buffer gas around 25K, independent of mass ratio and confinement potential of the trap. Different possible explanations for this incomplete thermalisation are discussed, among them the thermalisation of the buffer gas, room temperature blackbody radiation or warm gas entering the trap, and heating due to energy transfer from rotationally excited hydrogen molecules.},

The minimal energy requirement path for the 1 ⇌ 2 isomerization proceeds via two successive 1,2-hydrogen migrations and involves the as yet unknown stable, linear C3H4+· ion 5. Isomerization via a direct 1,3-hydrogen migration is, if it is involved at all, energetically less favoured. The ion 5 also serves as the central intermediate for ring closure to the cation radical of cyclopropene (4), which itself is the actual precursor for loss of H· thus generating the cyclopropenylium ion (3).

Values of [{CO}+]/[{HCO} +] {>}0.04 are measured across the inner 650 pc of the nuclear disk of M82. Such high values of [{CO}+]/[{HCO}+] have previously only been measured toward the atomic peak in the reflection nebula {NGC} 7023. This detection corroborates the scenario in which the molecular gas reservoir in the M82 disk is heavily affected by the {UV} radiation from recently formed stars. Comparing the column densities measured in M82 with those found in prototypical Galactic photon-dominated regions ({PDRs}), we need ?20 clouds along the line of sight to explain our observations. We have completed our model of the molecular gas chemistry in the M82 nucleus. Our {PDR} chemical model successfully explains the [{CO}+]/[{HCO}+] ratios measured in the M82 nucleus but fails by an order of magnitude to explain the large measured {CO}+ column densities [?(1-4) ? 1013 cm-2].

  abstract     = {We have carried out a survey of reactive ions ({CO}+, {HOC}+O+, {SO}+) and cyclopropenylidene (C3H2) in three prototypical photodissociation regions ({PDRs}), the reflection nebula {NGC} 7023, the Orion Bar and the planetary nebula ({PN}) {NGC} 7027. The reactive ion {CO}+ has been detected in all the targets with fractional abundances ranging from ∼10-11 to ∼a few 10-9. Its spatial distribution in {NGC} 7023 and the Orion Bar show that {CO}+ arises in the innermost part (Av {<} 2 mag) of the {PDR}. In {NGC} 7027, the {CO}+ lines shows an expansion velocity higher than that of the {CO} lines. This high expansion velocity is consistent with the {CO}+ emission arising in the high velocity layer of neural gas which is being accelerated by the ionized gas. Photochemistry determines the chemical composition of this layer. The reactive ions {HOC}+ and {SO}+ have been detected in {NGC} 7023 and the Orion Bar. In both sources, the fractional abundance of {HOC}+ is enhanced by a factor of ∼10 towards the {PDRs}, with typical abundances, {XHOC}+ = 0.7-3 × 10-11. This enhancement produces a decrease of the [{HCO}+]/[{HOC}+] abundance ratio towards the {PDR}. In fact, we have derived [{HCO}+]/[{HOC}+] ∼ 50-120 in {NGC} 7023, which is the lowest ratio measured thus far. {HOC}+ and {SO}+ have not been detected in {NGC} 7027. Interestingly, this is the source with the highest {CO}+ abundance, {XCO}+ = 5 × 10-9. This lack of detection is interpreted as due to the peculiar chemistry of C-rich {PNs}, in which the abundance of oxygenated molecules, in particular H2O, is low. We have detected cyclopropenylidene (C3H2) in the three target {PDRs}. Similarly to the reactive ions, the abundance of C3H2 in {NGC} 7023 and the Orion Bar is a factor of 10-100 higher in the {PDRs} than in the foreground molecular cloud with peak values ranging from 10-10 to 10-9. In {NGC} 7027, we measured the maximum C3H2 abundance with a value of ∼10-8. Similarly to the case of {CO}+, the high expansion velocities of the C3H2 lines in {NGC} 7027 suggests that its emission arises in the neutral gas which is being accelerated by the ionized gas. Photodestruction of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon ({PAHs}) is proposed to explain the enhanced C3H2 abundance in these {PDRs}.},

  abstract     = {This review summarizes experimental activities to study the structure of molecular ions via He tagging. The method is based on the attachment of a weakly bound helium atom to a cold ion followed by laser-induced predissociation ({LIP}). Since my early involvements (it started in 1977 with a letter from Y.T. Lee), radio frequency (rf) ion traps and ion guides have been important elements in instruments dedicated to ion spectroscopy. Accumulating ions in a ring electrode trap ({RET}) and confining them together with the laser-induced photofragments in a long octopole has been demonstrated in 1978 in Berkeley via photodissociation of metastable O2+ ions. In the early stage of this instrument, as well as in various further developments, supersonic expansions have been used to create weakly bound complexes. An important step forward for ion spectroscopy was to push the conditions of cryogenic ion traps so far that, finally, He atoms could be attached to almost any mass-selected ion of interest, including multiply charged ions and C60+. Currently, modern ion storage instruments reach temperatures below 3 K and can be operated at helium densities above 1016 cm−3, opening up many avenues of application in spectroscopy, reaction dynamics, and analytical chemistry. In addition to a personal historical review, I discuss recent progress made with new cryogenic ion traps, especially in the field of He tagging. He-M+ ions have been formed via ternary association for all kind of M+ ions ranging from atoms such as He+, N+, or Fe+ via molecules N2+, {VO}+, and H3+ to various polyatomic ions. The in situ synthesis of tagged ions made unique discoveries possible, such as determining the structure of doubly charged benzene, the first identification of a carrier of diffuse interstellar bands, or the characterization of the fundamental 4 electron 4 center system He–H3+. In the conclusions, hints to additional applications will be given, emphasizing on the versatility of temperature-variable ion traps.},

We use local thermodynamical equilibrium radiative transfer modeling coupled with a Bayesian statistical method which takes into account outliers to analyze the data from the Nobeyama spectral survey of TMC-1 between 8 and 50 GHz. We compute the abundance relative to molecular hydrogen of 57 molecules, including 19 isotopologues in TMC-1 along with their associated uncertainty. The new results are in general agreement with previous abundance determination from Ohishi & Kaifu and the values reported in the review from Agúndez & Wakelam. However, in some cases, large opacity and low signal to noise effects allow only upper or lower limits to be derived, respectively.},

@article{greene_universal_2017,
  abstract     = {A recent rejuvenation of experimental and theoretical interest in the physics of few-body systems has provided deep, fundamental insights into a broad range of problems. Few-body physics is a cross-cutting discipline not restricted to conventional subject areas such as nuclear physics or atomic or molecular physics. To a large degree, the recent explosion of interest in this subject has been sparked by dramatic enhancements of experimental capabilities in ultracold atomic systems over the past decade, which now permit atoms and molecules to be explored deep in the quantum mechanical limit with controllable two-body interactions. This control, typically enabled by magnetic or electromagnetically dressed Fano-Feshbach resonances, allows, in particular, access to the range of universal few-body physics, where two-body scattering lengths far exceed all other length scales in the problem. The Efimov effect, where three particles experiencing short-range interactions can counterintuitively exhibit an infinite number of bound or quasibound energy levels, is the most famous example of universality. Tremendous progress in the field of universal Efimov physics has taken off, driven particularly by a combination of experimental and theoretical studies in the past decade, and prior to the first observation in 2006, by an extensive set of theoretical studies dating back to 1970. Because experimental observations of Efimov physics have usually relied on resonances or interference phenomena in three-body recombination, this connects naturally with the processes of molecule formation in a low-temperature gas of atoms or nucleons, and more generally with N-body recombination processes. Some other topics not closely related to the Efimov effect are also reviewed in this article, including confinement-induced resonances for explorations of lower-dimensionality systems, and some chemically interesting systems with longer-range forces such as the ion-atom-atom recombination problem.},

A minimal-effort strategy is outlined that leads to an amplitude-replicated, communication-minimized implementation by parallelizing the time-determining steps for {CCSD} and {CCSD}(T). The resulting algorithm is aimed at affordable cluster architectures consisting of compute nodes with sufficient memory and local disk space and that are connected by standard communication networks like Gigabit Ethernet. While this scheme has disadvantages in the limit of very large numbers of compute nodes, it proves to be an efficient way of reducing the overall computational time for large-scale coupled-cluster calculations. In this way, {CCSD}(T) calculations of molecular properties such as vibrational frequencies or {NMR}-chemical shifts for systems with more than 1000 basis functions are feasible. A thorough analysis of the time-determining steps for {CCSD} and {CCSD}(T) energies, gradients, and second derivatives is carried out. Benchmark calculations are presented, proving that the parallelization of these steps is sufficient to obtain an efficient parallel scheme. This also includes the calculation of parallel {CCSD} energies and gradients using unrestricted ({UHF}) and restricted open-shell ({ROHF}) Hartree−Fock references, parallel {UHF}-{CCSD}(T) energies and gradients, parallel {ROHF}-{CCSD}(T) energies as well as parallel equation-of-motion {CCSD} energies and gradients for closed- and open-shell references. First applications to the calculation of the {NMR} chemical shifts of benzene using large basis sets and to the calculation of the equilibrium geometry of ferrocene as well as energy calculations with more than 1300 basis functions demonstrate the efficiency of the implementation.},

The physical conditions of these objects are studied in order to understand how molecular clouds evolve and how stellar masses are determined.{<}i{>}Aims. {<}i/{>}The purpose of this study is to probe conditions in the dense, starless clump Ophichus D (Oph D).{<}i{>}Methods. {<}i/{>}The ground-state () rotational transition of {<}i{>}ortho{<}i/{>}-H{<}sub{>}2{<}sub/{>}D{<}sup{>}+{<}sup/{>} was observed with {APEX} towards the density peak of Oph D.{<}i{>}Results. {<}i/{>}The width of the H{<}sub{>}2{<}sub/{>}D{<}sup{>}+{<}sup/{>} line indicates that the kinetic temperature in the core is about 6 K. So far, this is the most direct evidence of such cold gas in molecular clouds. The observed H{<}sub{>}2{<}sub/{>}D{<}sup{>}+{<}sup/{>} spectrum can be reproduced with a hydrostatic model with the temperature increasing from about 6 K in the centre to almost 10 K at the surface. The model is unstable against any increase in the external pressure, and the core is likely to form a low-mass star.{<}i{>}Conclusions. {<}i/{>}The results suggest that an equilibrium configuration is a feasible intermediate stage of star formation even if the larger scale structure of the cloud is thought to be determined by turbulent fragmentation. In comparison with the isothermal case, the inward decrease in the temperature makes smaller, i.e. less massive, cores susceptible to externally triggered collapse.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {Å} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract     = {Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory ({SAPT}) offers insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions. In addition, accurate energies can be obtained from the wave function-based variant of {SAPT} provided that intramonomer electron correlation effects are included. We apply density-fitting ({DF}) approximations to the intramonomer correlation corrections in {SAPT}. The introduction of this approximation leads to an improvement in the computational cost of {SAPT} by reducing the scaling of certain {SAPT} terms, reducing the amount of disk I/O, and avoiding the explicit computation of certain types of {MO} integrals. We have implemented all the intramonomer correlation corrections to {SAPT} through second-order under the {DF} approximation. Additionally, leading third-order terms are also implemented. The accuracy of this truncation of {SAPT} is tested against the S22 test set of Hobza and co-workers [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 8, 1985 (2006)]. When the intramonomer corrections to dispersion are included in {SAPT}, a mean absolute deviation of 0.3–0.4 kcal mol−1 is observed for the S22 test set when using an aug-cc-{pVDZ} basis. The computations on the adenine-thymine complexes in the S22 test set with an aug-cc-{pVDZ} basis represent the largest {SAPT} computations to date that include this degree of intramonomer correlation. Computations of this size can now be performed routinely with our newly developed {DF}-{SAPT} program.},

By analyzing archival data obtained by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we successfully detected submillimeter rotational transitions of (J = 19–18) located in the 338 GHz band in Titan’s atmospheric spectra. By comparing those observations with the simultaneously observed (J = 19–18) lines in the 349 GHz band, which probe from 160 to ∼400 km altitude, we then derived 14N/15N in as 125. Although the range of the derived value shows insufficient accuracy due to limitations on data quality, the best-fit value suggests that 14N/15N for is higher than values that have previously been observed and theoretically predicted for HCN and .

  abstract     = {The combination of a 4 K 22-pole ion trap instrument, {FELion}, with the widely tunable free electron lasers at the {FELIX} Laboratory is described in detail. It allows for wide-range infrared vibrational spectroscopy of molecular ions. In this study, the apparatus is used for infrared vibrational predissociation ({IR}-{PD}) measurements of the simple alcohol cations of methanol and ethanol as well as their protonated forms. Spectra are taken by tagging the cold molecular ions with He atoms. The infrared spectrum of protonated methanol is recorded for the first time, and the wavelength coverage for all other species is substantially extended. The bands of all spectra are analysed by comparison to ab initio calculation results at different levels of theory. Vibrational bands of different isomers and conformers (rotamers) are discussed and identified in the experimental spectra. Besides the measurement of {IR}-{PD} spectra, the method of infrared multiple photon dissociation {IR}-{MPD} is applied for some cases. Spectral narrowing due to the cold environment is observed and rotational band contours are simulated. This will help in identifying more complex species using the {IR}-{MPD} method in future measurements. Overall the {IR}-{PD} spectra reveal more bands than are observed for the {IR}-{MPD} spectra. In particular, many new bands are observed in the fingerprint region. Depletion saturation of the finite number of trapped ions is observed for the {IR}-{PD} spectra of the ethanol cation and the presence of only one isomeric species is concluded. This special feature of ion trapping spectroscopy may be used in future studies for addressing specific isomers or cleaning the ion cloud from specific isomers or conformers. In addition, the results of this study can be used as a basis to obtain high-resolution infrared vibrational and {THz} rotational spectra of alcohol ions in order to detect them in space.},

We report here the full mid-infrared vibrational spectrum of C7H7+ tagged with Ne obtained with infrared-predissociation spectroscopy at 10 K. Saturation depletion measurements were used to assign the contribution of benzylium and tropylium isomers and demonstrate that no other isomer is involved. Recorded spectral features compare well with density functional theory calculations. This opens perspectives for a better understanding and control of the formation paths leading to either tropylium or benzylium ions.},

For this, the ν1 ro-vibrational band has been revisited, detecting 108 transitions, among which 36 are new. The use of a frequency comb system allowed us to measure the ro-vibrational transitions with high precision and accuracy, typically better than 1MHz. The high precision has been confirmed by comparing equal combination differences in the ground and excited state. Moreover, precise predictions of pure rotational transitions were possible for the ground state. Twenty-five rotational transitions have been detected directly by a novel {IR}-mm-wave double resonance method, giving rise to highly accurate ground state spectroscopic parameters.},

Here we argue that the distinct peak observed at mass 39 {AMU} is due to the aromatic cation C3H3+ (cyclopropenyl). Laboratory mass spec-troscopy of unsaturated hydrocarbon-chain molecules and aromatics yields large intensities of mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 39; the spectra of the aromatic molecules also indicate the presence of C4H3+ (m/z =51) and C5H5+ (m/z =65). These latter products are not seen in the {PICCA} data, suggesting that in the cometary environment unsaturated hydrocarbon chains predominate over aromatics. We suggest that the progenitor of the hydrocarbon chains (which are apparently the parents of the C3H3+ ion) are the '{CHON}' dust particles observed around the comet3; the C3H3+ ion may also be one of the parent molecules of C3, which is a common feature of cometary spectra4, although its origin has remained obscure.},

Ion excitation by bound-bound terahertz absorption is probed by absorption in the visible on a bound-free transition. The visible frequency is tuned to a state-selective photodetachment transition of the excited anions. This provides a terahertz action spectrum for just a few hundred molecular ions. To demonstrate this we measure the two lowest rotational transitions, J=1←0 and J=2←1 of {OD}− anions in a cryogenic 22-pole trap. We obtain rotational transition frequencies of 598 596.08(19) {MHz} for J=1←0 and 1 196 791.57(27) {MHz} for J=2←1 of {OD}−, in good agreement with their only previous measurement. This two-photon scheme opens up terahertz rovibrational spectroscopy for a range of molecular anions, in particular for polyatomic and cluster anions.},

  abstract     = {A consistent explanation for the so-called unidentified {IR} emission features of interstellar dust is proposed. Following Sellgren (1984), the transient heating of very small grains to a peak temperature of about 1000 K by the absorption of a single {UV} photon is considered, and the subsequent {IR} emission is estimated. It is shown that graphite is one of the few solids that would not sublime under such conditions, and that the stretching modes of the {CH} radicals resulting from the conditions give an excellent fit to the observed 3.28 micron emission band. It is demonstrated that bulk graphite optical constants are inadequate for small carbon clusters due to a size effect. The expected emission of coronene, a medium-sized polycyclic aromatic molecule, heated to an average temperature of 600 K is computed and the spectral features are found to be in impressive agreement with most of the observed emission bands.},

In total, 39 rovibrational transitions within the fundamental band of the ν2 symmetric C-H stretch were measured around 3026 cm-1, which were used to predict pure rotational transition frequencies of {CH}2NH2+ in the ground vibrational state. Based on these predictions, nine rotational transitions were observed between 109 and 283 {GHz} using a novel double resonance method, which significantly improved the sensitivity of the rotational measurements. This double resonance method consists of rotational excitation followed by vibrational excitation, which is finally detected as a dip in the number of {CH}2NH2+-He complexes formed in the 4 K He bath of the trap. The new measurements and the derived predictions of pure rotational transitions will enable the first radio-astronomical search for {CH}2NH2+},

  abstract     = {In the past several years, great progress has been made on the spectroscopy of polyatomic molecules in diffuse interstellar clouds. In this talk, I will review recent developments involving H\$\_3{\textasciicircum}+\$, C\$\_3\$, and the Diffuse Interstellar Bands ({DIBs}).The simplest polyatomic molecular ion, H\$\_3{\textasciicircum}+\$, has long been recognized as the cornerstone of ion-neutral chemistry in dense molecular clouds (Herbst \& Klemperer 1973; Watson 1973). However, in diffuse clouds (where electrons are abundantly produced from photoionization of atomic carbon) the H\$\_3{\textasciicircum}+\$ number density was expected to be considerably lower than in dense clouds, owing to the efficiency of electron recombination. It was, therefore, a surprise when a large column density of H\$\_3{\textasciicircum}+\$ was detected ({McCall} et al.1998) in the diffuse line of sight towards Cygnus {OB}2 12, and subsequently in a sample of heavily reddened diffuse sightlines ({McCall} et al.2002). Recently, we have detected H\$\_3{\textasciicircum}+\$ even in the classical diffuse cloud sightline towards \${\textbackslash}zeta\$ Persei; together with a new measurement of the electron recombination rate coefficient, this result suggests that the cosmic-ray ionization rate is much higher in diffuse clouds than in dense clouds ({McCall} et al. 2003a)!In 2001, interstellar C\$\_3\$ was first detected by J. P. Maier and colleagues (maier et al. 2001) in three diffuse cloud sightlines. This was quickly followed up by another detection (Roueff et al. 2002) and a survey conducted at low-resolution (Okaet al. 2003). This was followed by a high-resolution survey (Ádámkovics, Blake, \& {McCall} 2003) that yielded rotationally resolved spectra of C\$\_3\$ in 10 sightlines. Much like C\$\_2\$, C\$\_3\$ has no permanent dipole moment, and therefore its rotational distribution serves as a sensitive diagnostic of both temperature and density.The existence of larger polyatomic molecules in diffuse clouds is clear from the presence of the {DIBs}, which have remained an enigma since their discovery some eight decades ago. A recent survey of the {DIBs} at the Apache Point Observatory has resulted in a uniform sample of {DIB} spectra with much higher signal-to-noise ratios than previously available. Some early results from the analysis of the survey data include the identification of a set of {DIBs} that are related to C\$\_2\$ (Thorburn et al. 2003) as well as some well-correlated pairs of {DIBs}. I will discuss our recent results.},

Lett. 98, 223001 (2007)] that the storage time of a thermal ensemble of ions in a multipole radiofrequency (rf) ion trap is ultimately limited by ion evaporation. An analysis of the evaporation rate was used to determine an effective trap depth as a function of the rf amplitude. This revealed that already for moderate rf amplitudes and low average stability parameter η the loss of ions is driven by nonadiabatic motion of the fastest ions in the rf field. Here we present the details of the experimental procedure together with our experimental apparatus, which combines a 22-pole rf ion trap with tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry for ion selection and product analysis. We furthermore describe in detail the numerical and analytical models used in the interpretation of our results, which allows one to predict the most favorable trapping conditions in multipole rf ion traps. From a fit to our data we obtain a maximal value of the multipole stability parameter of ηmax=0.36±0.02 for adiabatic ion motion.},

  abstract     = {We identify plain evaporation of ions as the fundamental loss mechanism out of a multipole ion trap. Using thermalized negative Cl− ions we find that the evaporative loss rate is proportional to a Boltzmann factor. This thermodynamic description allows us to extract the effective depth of the ion trap. As a function of the rf amplitude we find two distinct regimes related to the stability of motion of the trapped ions. For low amplitudes the entire trap allows for stable motion and the trap depth increases with the rf field. For larger rf amplitudes rapid energy transfer from the field to the ion motion can occur at large trap radii, which leads to a reduction of the effective trapping volume. In this regime the trap depth decreases again with increasing rf amplitude. We give an analytical parametrization of the trap depth for various multipole traps that allows predictions of the most favorable trapping conditions.},

Presently, the wavelength range of operation extends from 5 to 110 μm (2000−90 cm−1). The wavelength is continuously tunable over an octave in a few minutes. The output normally consists of macropulses of 5–10 μs duration, formed by a train of micropulses of a few ps length. Average power in the macropulses is of order 10 {kW}, peak power in the micropulses is in the {MW} range. The temporal and spectral characteristics of the micropulses can be controlled by varying the synchronism between the electron pulses and the optical pulses circulating in the laser cavity. Transform-limited pulse lengths in the range 2–20 ps can be generated. Long-range coherence has been induced by phase-locking successive micropulses, and narrow-band, essentially single-mode, radiation has been selected from the output.},

This comprehensive data set involves previously published absolute high resolution dipole (e,e) spectra of the valence shell discrete region combined with very wide range low resolution measurements in the ionization continuum for each atom or molecule. The absolute scales established for the dipole (e,e) spectra using the S(O) sum-rule in the originally published works (data available on the world wide web at ftp://chem.ubc.ca/pub/cooper or by anonymous ftp - see end of present paper for more details) are assessed by deriving static dipole polarizabilities for each atom and molecule using the S(−2) sum-rule. These values are found to be highly consistent with experimental and theoretical literature values of the static dipole polarizability and in almost all cases well within the estimated ±5\% accuracy of the originally published {TRK} sum-rule normalized absolute photoabsorption differential oscillator strength spectra. Significant errors of 8\% and 19\% in the previously published absolute oscillator strength scales for {CCl}4 (G.R. Burton, W.F. Chan, G. Cooper, C.E. Brion, Chem. Phys. 181 (1994) 147) and {SiF}4 (X. Guo, G. Cooper, W.F. Chan, G.R. Burton, C.E. Brion, Chem. Phys. 161 (1992) 453, 471) respectively are revealed by the dipole polarizability analysis and approproate corrections are recommended. Alternative methods of absolute scale determination for photoabsorption spectra using static or dynamic dipole polarizabilities from refractive index or dielectric constant measurements are also considered. These are found to be particularly useful especially where data are restricted to lower photon energies ({<} 60 {eV}) or where phenomena such as low lying inner shells, continuum shape resonances or Cooper minima preclude the use of the valence shell {TRK} sum-rule. As a result of the assessment of the absolute scales for the published dipole (e,e) spectra and since polarizabilities and refractive index data can typically be obtained with even higher precision (+-1\%), these data have been used to further refine the measured differential oscillator strength scales. On this basis, dipole oscillator strength sums S(u) (u = −1, −2, −3, −4, −5, −6, −7, −10) and L(u) (u = −1, −2, −3, −4, −5, −6) are obtained from the df/{dE} spectra. For many of the systems considered, the presently reported dipole sums are derived molecular properties are more accurate than previously reported values. In fact, for 28 of the 52 small molecules these sum-rule values represent the only available values. The dipole sums can be used to calculate normal Verdet constants which are involved in the Faraday effect. It is also shown that accurate values of the rotationally averaged C6(A,B) dispersion coefficients for the long-range interaction of all possible pairs of atomic and/or molecular species can be obtained from the measured differential oscillator strength spectra. Alternatively, an approximation to C6(A,B), requiring only the S(−2) and L(−2) sums, is shown to provide very reliable estimates of C6(A,B).},

Gas-phase polyaromatic hydrocarbons are photoionized by an excimer laser and stored in a quadrupole ion trap. Subsequent interaction with the intense infrared radiation of a free electron laser that is tuned in resonance with an infrared-allowed transition of the ion leads to sequential multiphoton absorption facilitated by rapid intramolecular vibrational redistribution. Absorption of more than 50-100 infrared photons raises the internal energy to above the dissociation threshold, leading eventually to fragmentation of the ion. Mass selective detection of the cationic species stored in the trap yields the infrared absorption spectrum of the parent ion.},

  abstract     = {In this review, we present an overview of our recent work on the infrared spectroscopy of mass-selected gas-phase molecular ions. The ions are stored and isolated in a quadrupole ion trap where they are investigated with infrared multiple photon dissociation spectroscopy using a free electron laser ({FEL}). The wide and continuous tunability of {FELIX}, the {FEL} for Infrared {eXperiments} at the {FOM} institute for Plasma Physics in The Netherlands, allows us to explore the interesting mid-infrared range between 500 and 2000 cm−1, sometimes referred to as the fingerprint region. The experiments have focused on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons because of their hypothesized occurrence in the interstellar medium, both in neutral and cationic forms. Furthermore, several related species of fundamental chemical interest have been investigated, such as molecular fragment ions and protonated species. The spectra are compared to theoretical spectra calculated at the density functional theory level. The effects of multiple photon excitation and dissociation dynamics on the appearance of the spectrum are extensively discussed. A mathematical model to account for the effects of anharmonicity is described. It explains for instance, qualitatively, how the observed spectral response can vary (slightly) with the fragment channel, which allows one to “direct” dissociation reactions in a non-coherent fashion by the choice of the infrared excitation wavelength.},

Measurements of the detachment cross section as a function of laser frequency near threshold have been analysed. Using this bound-free spectroscopy approach we could demonstrate rotational and vibrational cooling of the trapped anions by the buffer gas in the multipole trap. Below 50 K the {OH}- rotational temperature shows deviations from the buffer gas temperature, and possible causes for this are discussed. For H 3O2- vibrational cooling of the lowest vibrational quantum states into the vibrational ground state is observed. Its photodetachment cross section near threshold is modelled with a Franck-Condon model, with a detachment threshold that is lower, but still in agreement with the expected threshold for this system. © the Owner Societies 2013.},

Ternary association rate coefficients, k3, and binary fragmentation rate coefficients, kf, were extracted from the measured temporal evolution of the hydrogen cluster ion intensity, I(Hi+), for i = 3,⋯,23. Pure para hydrogen enhances the rate coefficients for association and fragmentation. For i {>} 9 this general trend is explained by a difference in the capture cross-sections, kc, for the two hydrogen nuclear spin modifications. Significant differences in k3 which remain for small clusters (i {<} 9) are due to the availability of the J = 1 rotational energy of the ortho modification when merging into the cluster. This surprising result is discussed in the framework of simple dynamical and energetic considerations. Possible structures of the cluster can be classified and estimates for the bond energy of the outermost H2 in the cluster as a function of cluster size are derived.},

Operating at hydrogen number densities from 1011 to 1014 cm−3, the contributions of radiative, kr, and ternary, k3, association have been extracted from the measured apparent binary rate coefficients, k*=kr+k3[H2]. Surprisingly, k3 is constant between 11 and 22 K, (2.6±0.8)×10−29 cm6 s−1, while radiative association decreases from kr(11 K)=(1.6±0.3)×10−16 cm3 s−1 to kr(28 K)=(5±2)×10−17 cm3 s−1. These results are in conflict with simple association models in which formation and stabilization of the complex are treated separately. Tentative explanations are based on the fact that, at low temperatures, only few partial waves contribute to the formation of the collision complex and that ternary association with H2 may be quite inefficient because of the ‘shared proton’ structure of .},

A very good agreement between experimental and theoretical infrared frequencies is observed. The dominant structure of the C5H5N•+ cation is assigned to the aromatic pyridine radical cation form.

The C5H5NH+ cation is ascribed to the aromatic pyridinium cation where protonation has taken place on the nitrogen atom. The rare-gas tag used in the action spectroscopic method has a negligible effect on the vibrational frequencies.

  abstract     = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ({PAHs}) are abundant in many regions of the Universe, representing a major reservoir for cosmic carbon. However, their formation pathways in cold regions of space remain elusive. Recent astronomical detections show that current astrochemical models drastically underestimate the abundance of aromatic molecules and suggest that additional formation pathways such as ion–molecule reactions need to be considered. Here we reveal efficient low-temperature formation pathways towards nitrogen-containing {PAHs} via exothermic pyridine+ and acetylene ion–molecule reactions. The experimental approach combines kinetics with spectroscopic probing and unambiguously identifies key reaction intermediates and the final nitrogen-containing {PAH} product quinolizinium+, a structure that is thought to contribute to the 6.2 μm interstellar emission feature. This study not only provides competing formation pathways relevant in the chemistry of the interstellar medium and Titan’s atmosphere, but also delivers information to verify in-silico potential energy surfaces, astrochemical models and infrared observations.},

The instrument consists of a dual linear ion trap ({LIT}) based triple quadrupole axis intersecting a spectroscopic axis containing a 22-pole ion trap cooled to 5K. The triple quadrupole axis intersects the spectroscopy axis between the second and third quadrupoles, which are separated by an ion deflector that is used to direct ion injection into the cold ion trap from the second quadrupole and subsequently to direct ions ejected from the cold ion trap into the third quadrupole. Both the second and third quadrupoles can be operated as {LITs} capable of dipolar excitation across opposing quadrupole rods. Broad-band or single-frequency waveforms can be used to effect mass selection or mass analysis, respectively. The dual ion trapping capability allows for ion accumulation to occur in parallel with ion spectroscopy and mass analysis, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the experiment. Extensive use of homebuilt equipment has allowed for maximum flexibility, with capabilities for using ion/ion reactions in the ion generation step, and {IR}-{UV} double resonance spectroscopy during ion interrogation.},

We can generally reproduce their results, although we find that von Struve and Henderson have underestimated some of their measurement errors, leading to optimistic parallax uncertainties. We find that temperature corrections for Bessel's measured positions are larger than anticipated, explaining some systematics apparent in his data. It has long been a mystery as to why von Struve first announced a parallax for Vega of 0.″125 only to later revise it to double that value using more data. We resolve this mystery by finding that von Struve's early result used two dimensions of position data, which independently give significantly different parallaxes but, when combined, only fortuitously give the correct result. With later data, von Struve excluded the “problematic” dimension, leading to the larger parallax value. Allowing for likely temperature corrections and using his data from both dimensions reduce von Struve's parallax for Vega to a value consistent with the correct value.},

@article{roithova_helium_2016,
  abstract     = {{ConspectusThe} interrogation of reaction intermediates is key for understanding chemical reactions; however their direct observation and study remains a considerable challenge. Mass spectrometry is one of the most sensitive analytical techniques, and its use to study reaction mixtures is now an established practice. However, the information that can be obtained is limited to elemental analysis and possibly to fragmentation behavior, which is often challenging to analyze. In order to extend the available experimental information, different types of spectroscopy in the infrared and visible region have been combined with mass spectrometry.Spectroscopy of mass selected ions usually utilizes the powerful sensitivity of mass spectrometers, and the absorption of photons is not detected as such but rather translated to mass changes. One approach to accomplish such spectroscopy involves loosely binding a tag to an ion that will be removed by absorption of one photon. We have constructed an ion trapping instrument capable of reaching temperatures that are sufficiently low to enable tagging by helium atoms in situ, thus permitting infrared photodissociation spectroscopy ({IRPD}) to be carried out. While tagging by larger rare gas atoms, such as neon or argon is also possible, these may cause significant structural changes to small and reactive species, making the use of helium highly beneficial. We discuss the “innocence” of helium as a tag in ion spectroscopy using several case studies. It is shown that helium tagging is effectively innocent when used with benzene dications, not interfering with their structure or {IRPD} spectrum. We have also provided a case study where we can see that despite its minimal size there are systems where He has a huge effect. A strong influence of the He tagging was shown in the {IRPD} spectra of {HCCl}2+ where large spectral shifts were observed.While the presented systems are rather small, they involve the formation of mixtures of isomers. We have therefore implemented two-color experiments where one laser is employed to selectively deplete a mixture by one (or more) isomer allowing helium tagging {IRPD} spectra of the remaining isomer(s) to be recorded via the second laser. Our experimental setup, based on a linear wire quadrupole ion trap, allows us to deplete almost 100\% of all helium tagged ions in the trap. Using this special feature, we have developed attenuation experiments for determination of absolute photofragmentation cross sections. At the same time, this approach can be used to estimate the representation of isomers in a mixture. The ultimate aim is the routine use of this instrument and technique to study a wide range of reaction intermediates in catalysis. To this end, we present a study of hypervalent iron({IV})–oxo complexes ([(L)Fe(O)({NO}3)]+). We show that we can spectroscopically differentiate iron complexes with S = 1 and S = 2 according to the stretching vibrations of a nitrate counterion.},

  abstract     = {Infrared (IR) photodissociation spectra of isomeric C3H3+-L dimers with the inert ligands L = (Ne, Ar, O2, N2, and CO2 are recorded in the spectral range of the C-H stretch fundamentals. At least two C3H3+ isomers are generated by electron impact ionization of allene (H2CCCH2) in the cluster ion source, namely the cyclopropenyl (c-C3H3+) and propargyl (H2CCCH+) cations. Both C3H3+ ions form weakly-bound adducts with all ligands considered and the attraction in these ion-ligand complexes is dominated by induction and electrostatic forces. In general, the intermolecular interaction in both c-C3H3+-L and H2CCCH+-L increases in the order Ne{<}Ar{<}O2{<}N2{<}CO2, in line with the polarizabilities, quadrupole moments, and proton affinities) of L. Rovibrational analysis of the $\nu$4 vibrations of c-C3H3+-L involving molecular ligands reveals several competing structural binding motifs, including the formation of H-bonds (L = N2, CO2, O2), C-bonds (L = CO2, and $\pi$-bonds (L = O2). The preferred binding site and details of the equilibrium structure strongly depend on L. In contrast, the observed H2CCCH+-L dimers feature all H-bonds between L and the acetylenic proton. Ab initio calculations for c-C3H3+-L and H2CCCH+-L at the MP2(full)/6-311G(2df,2pd) level provide additional information about the intermolecular potential energy surface of these ion-ligand complexes and confirm the interpretation of the experimental IR spectra. Photofragmentation branching ratios observed for (c-C3H3+-(CO2)n with n = 1-3 allow the dissociation energy of the intermolecular H-bonds and C-bonds to be estimated as D0(H/C) = 1300±300 cm-1.},

  abstract     = {The laser induced charge transfer N2+ + Ar → Ar+ + N2 has been employed to measure rotationally resolved excitation spectra of N2+, held in a 22-pole ion trap. Detection of the Ar+ product ions proved to facilitate an almost background free spectroscopic method. Rotational temperatures and Doppler temperatures determined from these spectra show that the internal and translational degrees of freedom of the parent ions are very well coupled to the trap temperature via collisions with the Ar buffer gas. Laser excitation starts a complex reaction kinetics of the finite ensemble of N2+ ions. Various elementary reaction steps have been distinguished and followed in detail by varying laser duration, storage time, and target gas density. For a fixed temperature (90 K), specific rate coefficients have been determined. Pumping only one particular quantum state of ortho-N2+ (X2∑g, v″ = 0, J″ = 6.5) shows that rate coefficients for the mixing of fine structure states (F1/F2) as well as nuclear spin states (ortho/para) in collisions with Ar are negligible (smaller than 10−12 cm3 s−1). The rate coefficient for transitions between the rotational states of one subset, e.g. ortho-N2+ (F1), are surprisingly small. The results are discussed in the framework of possible dynamical constraints, e.g. imposed by the potential energy surface.},

The program is a hybrid of C++ and Python, and calculations may be run with very simple text files or using the Python {API}, facilitating post-processing and complex workflows; method developers also have access to most of {PSI}4’s core functionalities via Python. Job specification may be passed using The Molecular Sciences Software Institute ({MolSSI}) {QCSCHEMA} data format, facilitating interoperability. A rewrite of our top-level computation driver, and concomitant adoption of the {MolSSI} {QCARCHIVE} {INFRASTRUCTURE} project, makes the latest version of {PSI}4 well suited to distributed computation of large numbers of independent tasks.

It is shown that the primary mechanism for producing diatomic molecules from atoms is the radiative association of C + H and C + + H yielding {CR} and {CR} +. Dielectronic recombination of {CR} + is important in producing {CR}, destroying {CR} + and increasing the ratio {CR}/{CR} + relative to C/C +. Other important processes, including exothermic chemical exchange and charge-exchange reactions, lead to the production of C2, {CN}, and {CO}, but not {NO}, N2, or 02. The steady-state abundance of electrons, atoms, ions, and diatomic molecules composed of H, C, N, and 0 is determined as a function of the H density, the kinetic temperature, and the ultraviolet optical depth, which governs the photodissociation and ionization rates. A comparison of the theory with optical observations of the interstellar medium, particularly the well-studied features in the Oph spectrum, shows good qualitative and quantitative agreement. A molecular composition dominated by carbon monoxide and with a variety of diatomic species can be established in the interstellar medium by pure gasphase reactions.},

  abstract     = {Context. Observations of {CO}+ suggest column densities on the order 1012 cm12 that can not be reproduced by many chemical models. {CO}+ is more likely to be destroyed than excited in collisions with hydrogen. An anomalous excitation mechanism may thus have to be considered when interpreting {CO}+ observations. Other uncertainties in models are the chemical network, the gas temperature or the geometry of the emitting source. Similar is true for other reactive ions that will be observed soon with the Herschel Space Observatory.Aims. Chemical constraints are explored for observable {CO}+ abundances. The influence of an anomalous excitation mechanism on {CO}+ line intensities is investigated. Model results are compared to observations.Methods. Chemical models are used to perform a parameter study of {CO} + abundances. Line fluxes are calculated for N({CO}+)= 1012cm -2 and different gas densities and temperatures using a non-{LTE} escape probability method. The chemical formation and destruction rates are considered explicitly in the detailed balance equations of the radiative transfer. In addition, the rotational levels of {CO}+ are assumed to be excited upon chemical formation according to a formation temperature. Collisional excitation by atomic and molecular hydrogen as well as by electrons is studied for conditions appropriate to dense photon-dominated regions ({PDRs}) and star-forming environments.Results. Chemical models are generally able to produce high fractional {CO}+ abundances (x ({CO}+) ≈ 10-10). In a far-ultraviolet ({FUV}) dominated environment, however, high abundances of {CO}+ are only produced in regions with a Habing field G0 g∼ 100 and Tkin ≳ 600 K, posing a strong constraint on the gas temperature. For gas densities ≲ 106cm-3 and temperatures ≲ 600 K, the combination of chemical and radiative transfer analysis shows little effect on intensities of {CO}+ lines with upper levels Nup ≤ 3. Significantly different line fluxes are calculated with an anomalous excitation mechanism, however, for transitions with higher upper levels and densities ≳ 106 cm-3. The Herschel Space Observatory is able to reveal such effects in the terahertz wavelength regime. Ideal objects to observe are protoplanetary disks with densities gsim; 106 cm -3.It is finally suggested that the {CO}+ chemistry may be well understood and that the abundances observed so far can be explained with a high enough gas temperature and a proper geometry. © 2009 {ESO}.},

Relative reaction cross sections for two microscopic reaction mechanisms, i.e., proton transfer (PT) from the acetonitrile ion CH 3 CN + to neutral acetonitrile CH 3 CN and hydrogen atom abstraction (HA) by CH 3 CN + from CH 3 CN, have been determined for two low-lying electronic states, 2 E and 2 A 1 of the CH 3 CN + primary ion. The cross section for PT of the 2 A 1 state was smaller than that of the 2 E state, whereas that of HA are almost the same in the two states. Ab initio calculations showed that the dissociation of the C-H + bond of CH 3 CN + is easier in the 2 E state than that in the 2 A 1 state. The direct ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) calculations showed that two mechanisms, direct proton transfer and complex formation, contribute the reaction dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Previous investigations have employed more than 100 close observations of Titan by the Cassini orbiter to elucidate connections between the production and distribution of Titan’s vast, organic-rich chemical inventory and its atmospheric dynamics. However, as Titan transitions into northern summer, the lack of incoming data from the Cassini orbiter presents a potential barrier to the continued study of seasonal changes in Titan’s atmosphere. In our previous work (Thelen et al., 2018), we demonstrated that the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is well suited for measurements of Titan’s atmosphere in the stratosphere and lower mesosphere (∼100−500 km) through the use of spatially resolved (beam sizes  < 1′′) flux calibration observations of Titan. Here, we derive vertical abundance profiles of four of Titan’s trace atmospheric species from the same 3 independent spatial regions across Titan’s disk during the same epoch (2012–2015): HCN, HC3N, C3H4, and CH3CN. We find that Titan’s minor constituents exhibit large latitudinal variations, with enhanced abundances at high latitudes compared to equatorial measurements; this includes CH3CN, which eluded previous detection by Cassini in the stratosphere, and thus spatially resolved abundance measurements were unattainable. Even over the short 3-year period, vertical profiles and integrated emission maps of these molecules allow us to observe temporal changes in Titan’s atmospheric circulation during northern spring. Our derived abundance profiles are comparable to contemporary measurements from Cassini infrared observations, and we find additional evidence for subsidence of enriched air onto Titan’s south pole during this time period. Continued observations of Titan with ALMA beyond the summer solstice will enable further study of how Titan’s atmospheric composition and dynamics respond to seasonal changes.},

The current version can handle linear molecules, symmetric tops and asymmetric tops and many possible transitions, both allowed and forbidden, including multiphoton and Raman spectra in addition to the common electric dipole absorptions. Many different interactions can be included in the calculation, including those arising from electron and nuclear spin, and external electric and magnetic fields. Multiple states and interactions between them can also be accounted for, limited only by available memory. Fitting of experimental data can be to line positions (in many common formats), intensities or band contours and the parameters determined can be level populations as well as rotational constants. pgopher is provided with a powerful and flexible graphical user interface to simplify many of the tasks required in simulating, understanding and fitting molecular spectra, including Fortrat diagrams and energy level plots in addition to overlaying experimental and simulated spectra. The program is open source, and can be compiled with open source tools. This paper provides a formal description of the operation of version 9.1.},

Hydrogen recombination lines are also observed; they indicate an amount of thermal bremsstrahlung emission equivalent to 0.8 Jy of radio flux at 3.5 mm and provide an estimate of approximately 25 magnitudes for the extinction to the H {II} region. An upper limit on the 8.99-micron forbidden Ar {III} line intensity together with the measured forbidden Ar {II} intensity implies that the excitation of the H {II} region is extremely low. Comparison of fine-structure lines, including the 8- to 13-micron data of Gillett et al. (1973), with the hydrogen lines shows that argon and neon have approximately their cosmic abundance.},

  abstract     = {{The Cl loss from the propargyl chloride molecular ion has been investigated using mass-analyzed ion kinetic energy spectrometry (MIKES), The kinetic energy release distribution in the unimolecular dissociation has been determined. The potential energy surface for the mechanistic pathway has been calculated at the B3LYP/6-311G{*}{*} density functional theory level. The calculated potential energy surface suggested that the threshold dissociation of the propargyl chloride molecular ion produces the C3H3+ ion, only with the cyclopropenium structure, and with the release of a large amount of kinetic energy. This is in agreement with experimental results. Also, calculation of the rate constants with statistical rate models predicted that the reaction observed on a microsecond time scale occurs via tunneling through the rate-determining isomerization barrier for H-atom transfer. It has been found that a broad lifetime distribution is a manifestation of quantum mechanical tunneling of a precursor prepared under thermal conditions. Reinterpretation of previous photoelectron-photoion coincidence results taking into account the tunneling effect necessitated raising the critical energy to 0.64 eV from the energy of 0.34 eV reported previously.

  abstract     = {The vibrational transitions and the relative abundances of the two isomeric ions H2CNH+ and H2NCH+ generated through electron impact ionisation have been investigated in a noble gas tagging experiment. It could be shown that both species were formed with an abundance of 70 and 30\% for H2NCH+ and H2CNH+, respectively. The obtained vibrational bands of the two species have been assigned to vibrational transitions through comparison with the results of ab initio calculations. These computations also predict both species to be moderately polar. The present investigations show that both isomers should be included in chemical model calculations of dark interstellar clouds, protoplanetary disks, star-forming regions as well as planetary atmospheres.},
